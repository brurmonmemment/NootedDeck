# NootedDeck
ðŸ›ˆ brurmonemt 2025

A kext designed to get the Steam Deck's LCD and OLED GPUs working (Van Gogh)

<hr>

### DISCLAIMER
- This was **NOT** made by ChefKiss or their devs, but this is based on their work, more specifically [NootedRed](https://github.com/ChefKissInc/NootedRed/) and [NootRX](https://github.com/ChefKissInc/NootRX) and their source code.
- The kext is more of a personal rework of the projects, and I don't claim credit for any of the base code and logic (excluding Navi 24 and some RDNA 2 code if anything new's added).

**No copyright infringement intended**
